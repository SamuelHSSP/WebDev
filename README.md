# WebDev
Fullstack web development with the latest tools.
## Frontend
The following are the skills you need to learn (in the order listed) to be a great Frontend developer:

1. HTML --> HTML5
2. CSS --> CSS3
3. JavaScript
4. React/Vue/Angular

## Backend
To be a backend developer, there are many tools available. But here are a few of them:

1. Flask. It uses Python
2. Django (used by Instagram). The programming language involved is Python.
3. NodeJS. The programming language used here is JavaScript.
4. PHP is also used in the backend.

If you really love Python, I'd advise you start with Flask, then move to Django for your big projects.
But if JavaScript is your best language, then NodeJS should be your choice. Feel free to experiment with all the tools if you know both Python and JavaScript, then stick to the one you love the most.

## Other Skills
Of course, there are other skills you need to be a fullstack developer. Not just about the coding part, you learn to learn other useful skills like the following:

**1. UI/UX Design**. The design can either make your visitors stay on your website or leave. Make sure you understand the principles of design, and how to apply them.
I recommend Figma, but you could also try out AdobeXD. Those two are very great in creating designs.

**2. Cybersecurity**. You don't want to build a website where a 13-year-old boy learning how to hack can just hack. To avoid getting 'pwned', especially if you're storing information, you need to have cybersecurity skills. Know how to make your database very secure, and store passwords and signin details carefully.
Talking about databases, you need them to store information from your website. When a new user signs up on the website, you have to store their info on your database. There are many databases you can try, but I would list a few of them.
#### SQL

1. MySQL
2. SQLite
3. PosgreSQL

#### No-SQL

1. GridDB
2. MongoDB
3. MariaDB

**3. Product Management**. You need to understand that a fullstack that connects design to frontend, and then to backend must be skilled in almost everything. It seems as if all the work is on you. You need to have product management skills to ensure you're productive in your work.


## YouTube
Show me a programmer that learns from watching the right YouTube videos and I will show you a programmer that understands how to solve problems with coding. Learning from books is good, but when you see that code getting written and seeing how it works, gives you the experience you need. I will share a few links to great YouTube channels where you can learn web development.

1. [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/videos)
2. [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw)
3. [Trasversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)
4. [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh)

And if you want to download the videos, you can try out [CMDTube](https://pypi.org/project/cmdtube/) - a Python library I created for you. You can get information about YouTube videos, watch them, search for tutorials, and even download them. How cool is that!
